  <p><strong><em>Practical tool that'll help you perform day-to-day tasks, about chemistry and biology</em></strong></p>
  <p>This is another website where you can calculate molar, normal, and percentage v/v, w/v solutions. Also, any dilution that you need... annealing temperatures, fold changes for qPCR, among other things. From solutions, how to prepare them:
    chemical compound, molecular weight, molarity required, volume required; from dilutions, what is the stock volume required, the molarity of a final solution, and how to perform a serial dilution</p>
